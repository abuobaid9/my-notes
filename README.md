# Introduce Myself 
Hi..
 my name is Anas abu obeid, I am 23 years old and I live in zarqa,
 I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from al albayt University,
 I worked as a computer maintenance and support technician for the past 2 years.

 ## What I Learned from this [article](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-learn-things-fast-without-going-crazy)
 1. I learned that it is not necessary to be restricted to one programming language and that I can build the same project in more than one language

 2. *I also learned how to search for a crash course on YouTube*

3. It is also **important** to build a different project from what we see in the courses, as this will make you apply what you have learned
